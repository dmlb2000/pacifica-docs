# Pacifica Testing Guidelines

All testing for officially supported Pacifica code repositories
must perform the following tasks.

 * Code Style Linting - Code in any language can be unintentionally
   obfuscated to the point of unreadability by others. Code style 
   linters enforce standard ways of coding that improve readability.
 * Code Coverage - A combination of both Unit and Functional testing
   must demonstrate 100 percent coverage.
 * Continious Integration - The above methods for Code Style Linting
   and Coverage Testing must be run on every pull request in CI.

## Language Specific Standards

The language specific standards for the above requirements are kept
in template repositories in the Pacifica organization. Alterations
and additions to the testing standards should be addressed there
before project specific exceptions are documented.
